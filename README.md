## Module 1

- [Essential R skills](Module_1/Intro_R.html)

This session will introduce the basics of R and RStudio.

If you already have experience in R and are comfortable with creating and manipulating objects, applying functions, and using RStudio, you may skip this session. *If you are not familiar with R, it is essential that you attend this session!* We will assume basic proficiency with R in all subsequent classes, without time to catch people up.
