Download and install the **latest versions** of R and RStudio if using your own laptop. If you already have R and RStudio installed, but you installed them a while ago, you should update both.

- R can be downloaded from [r-project.org](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/)

- RStudio can be obtained from [https://posit.co/downloads/](https://posit.co/downloads/)
