title: Essential R Skills
---


Numerous beginners guides/tutorials for learning R are available online. Therefore we are refraining from suggesting any particular sources here. Still, if you can’t find anything, please feel free to contact instructors sooner than later. Since we will have very limited time during the modules to cover the materials we have planned, we won’t be able to offer any catch up lessons for those who are not familiar with the following basics. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have these skills **before you attend the first session scheduled for February 9, 2022**.


1. Get a free [GitHub account](https://github.com). Once you
login to your account, navigate to [this
repository](https://github.com/wyoibc/r4grads) and click on ``Watch`` button in
the top right corner. This will help you keep track of changes being made
upstream. We will update the repository periodically.

2. Install Git, the version control system on your computer

	- Mac OSX has a git client built into it. So no installation is
	  necessary.
	
	- If you use a Windows computer, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Please note that we will not able to offer any technical troubleshooting help for windows computers. 

3. Download and install the **latest versions** of R and RStudio

	- R can be downloaded from [r-project.org](https://r-project.org). 

	- RStudio can be obtained from [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)


4. Make sure your ``git`` installation works.

	- Mac OSX: Open Terminal.app, and type ``git --version``. This should
	  print git version to the screen. If you get an error message, contact
me (vchhatre at uwyo.edu).

	- Git for Windows: Right click on desktop and choose ``Git Bash``,
	  which should open up a terminal window. If you run into issues, make
sure you followed instructions on their website (see above).


5. Request access to the [class Slack
account](https://join.slack.com/t/r4grads/shared_invite/zt-11zz9u6jo-OGHMx9qq69rebOikGP9SYg).
When the class is in session, we will provide live help on this Slack channel. Outside of class, you can chat with your fellow classmates and instructors using this venue. We have found this to be an immensely useful resource.

6. Develop the following R skills

	- Find, install and load various R packages
	- Knowledge of main R repositories and how they function (CRAN, GitHub, Bioconductor)
	- Basic functions in R (calculator, creating objects, changing path, creating folders, getting directory listing)
	- Reading files in various formats (csv, tsv) and writing modified files to disk
	- Basic plotting using R-base graphics, familiarity with various plot types and aesthetic parameters to modify those plots 
	- Statistical tests and functions (t-test, anova etc.)
	- Saving your work in RData objects
